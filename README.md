# digital-portfolio-prp372

This digital portfolio is a structured collection of all the assessments I completed during the Work Readiness Training sessions. It contains clear evidence and in-depth personal reflections based on the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, and Result). All activities were completed individually.

# 1. Career Counselling

# Evidence
This task was completed as part of a class assessment. I participated in a guided career counselling session which included career exploration exercises and discussions focused on the ICT industry.

# Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness Training sessions, I was required to take part in a career counselling session. This session helped me explore different career options and evaluate which paths are best aligned with my personal goals, skills, and qualifications.

**Task:**  
I needed to assess my career goals, participate in the activities provided, and critically reflect on what I learned. I was responsible for identifying suitable career paths in the ICT industry based on the feedback from the session.

**Action:**  
I completed a career assessment quiz and carefully reviewed the results. I explored careers such as software developer, business analyst, and IT support technician. I also took notes on the qualifications and soft skills needed for each of these roles and reflected on how they matched my strengths and interests.

**Result:**  
This session gave me clarity about my professional goals. I realized that I am interested in roles that involve analytical thinking and problem-solving. I now have a clearer direction and have started planning steps toward gaining experience in those areas.

# 2. Skills and Interests

# Evidence
I completed a self-assessment during class to identify my key skills, strengths, and professional interests. This formed part of my individual assessment.

# Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
As part of the work readiness training, I was instructed to evaluate my personal and professional skills. This activity helped me understand how my current skill set aligns with the demands of the ICT job market.

**Task:**  
I needed to honestly assess my abilities, document my strongest skills, and identify the types of roles that suit my interests and personality.

**Action:**  
I completed the skills audit, which included both technical and soft skills. I listed problem-solving, communication, and adaptability as my top strengths. I also identified my interests in programming, systems analysis, and helping others through technical support. After the activity, I reviewed online resources to improve areas I’m weaker in, like time management and presentation skills.

**Result:**  
This reflection helped me confirm that my skills and interests align well with careers in IT support and software development. It also highlighted areas I need to improve. I have since started tracking my progress and actively looking for opportunities to build those weaker skills.

# 3. Personality Assessment

# Evidence
I completed a personality assessment that provided insights into how I behave, communicate, and make decisions. This task was done individually as part of a structured class activity.

# Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
I was asked to complete a personality test that would help me understand my traits and how they affect my career development. The assessment was intended to support my self-awareness and career planning.

**Task:**  
I had to answer a set of questions honestly to determine my personality type and reflect on how this influences my professional behavior and preferences.

**Action:**  
After completing the assessment, I received a result that described me as detail-oriented, responsible, and logical. These traits match well with roles that require structure, accuracy, and consistency. I then researched how people with similar personality types succeed in tech careers.

**Result:**  
The results of the personality test confirmed that I thrive in organized environments and prefer clear expectations and logical problem-solving. I now understand why I enjoy tasks that involve planning and coding. This reflection helped me align my career goals with my personal attributes.

# 4. CV Creation

# Evidence
I created a professional Curriculum Vitae (CV) as part of my individual work readiness assessment. I followed the structure provided by my lecturer and tailored the content to reflect my skills and goals.

# Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
I needed to create a formal CV that could be used for real job applications. This was a critical part of demonstrating my readiness for the working world.

**Task:**  
I was responsible for compiling a clean, professional CV that clearly outlined my academic background, experience, skills, and personal profile. It had to meet formatting standards and reflect who I am as a candidate.

**Action:**  
I started by gathering all necessary information such as my academic results, achievements, and personal details. I used a clean format with sections like Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact Information. I proofread the final version carefully to ensure there were no spelling or formatting errors.

**Result:**  
The result was a well-structured CV that I feel confident presenting to employers. I now understand how to tailor my CV for different job opportunities and how important it is to present my skills and qualifications professionally.

I had to ensure that the final version of my CV was properly formatted, named correctly, and submitted before the deadline.
